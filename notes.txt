 Instance Attributes vs. Class Attributes
Instance Attributes:

These are specific to each object (instance) of a class.
They are defined inside the constructor method (__init__()) using self.
Each instance can have its own unique value for the instance attributes.



Class Attributes:

These are shared by all instances of the class.
They are defined directly within the class but outside of any instance methods.
Changing a class attribute affects all instances.


Summary:
Instance Attributes: Defined in the __init__() method using self; unique to each instance.

Class Attributes: Defined directly in the class; shared by all instances.
Methods:


Instance methods:  Use self to access instance-specific data.


Class methods:  Use cls to access or modify class-level data.
Static methods :  No access to class or instance attributes; behave like regular functions within a class.
 

self is used to access attributes and methods of the current instance of the class.
